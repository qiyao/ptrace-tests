Purpose
-------

Most of the tests target ptrace(2) implementation.  Most of the ptrace(2) tests
have ever failed only on the ptrace-by-utrace implementation.

The tests/ subdirectory contains all the actual test sources.  On biarch
platforms, biarch-tests/ also gets built from the same sources using the
nondefault compiler mode.

Preparation:
	autoreconf -f -i
	./configure

Simple safe run:
	make check

Runs only the tests which crashed older kernels:
	make xcheck

Runs all the tests:
	make check xcheck

TESTTIME=<seconds> sets the testing time for the unreliable looping tests.
